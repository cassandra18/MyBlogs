            Software Engineer, Mother, and Dreamer
          </h2>
          <p className="tracking-wider">
            Life is a beautiful tapestry woven with threads of challenges,
            aspirations, and unwavering determination. As a young mother, my
            journey has been particularly enriching, filled with the joys and
            responsibilities of raising a daughter while simultaneously
            embarking on a path of self-discovery and growth. This path has led
            me to the dynamic and ever-evolving field of software engineering â€“
            a decision fueled by both pragmatism and a genuine passion for the
            craft.
